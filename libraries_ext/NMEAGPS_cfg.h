// If you don't know which sentence is the last one,

//------------------------------------------------------
// Enable/Disable coherency:
//
// If you need each fix to contain information that is only
// from the current update interval, you should uncomment
// this define.  At the beginning of the next interval,
// the accumulating fix will start out empty.  When
// the LAST_SENTENCE_IN_INTERVAL arrives, the valid
// fields will be coherent.

//#define NMEAGPS_COHERENT

// With IMPLICIT merging, fix() will be emptied when the
// next sentence begins.
//
// With EXPLICIT or NO merging, the fix() was already
// being initialized.
//
// If you use the fix-oriented methods available() and read(),
// they will empty the current fix for you automatically.
//
// If you use the character-oriented method decode(), you should
// empty the accumulating fix by testing and clearing the
// 'intervalComplete' flag in the same way that available() does.

//------------------------------------------------------
// Choose how multiple sentences are merged:
//   1) No merging
//        Each sentence fills out its own fix; there could be 
//        multiple sentences per interval.
//   2) EXPLICIT_MERGING
//        All sentences in an interval are *safely* merged into one fix.
//        NMEAGPS_FIX_MAX must be >= 1.
//        An interval is defined by NMEA_LAST_SENTENCE_IN_INTERVAL.
//   3) IMPLICIT_MERGING
//        All sentences in an interval are merged into one fix, with 
//        possible data loss.  If a received sentence is rejected for 
//        any reason (e.g., a checksum error), all the values are suspect.
//        The fix will be cleared; no members will be valid until new 
//        sentences are received and accepted.  This uses less RAM.

// Enable/disable the talker ID, manufacturer ID and proprietary message processing.
//
// First, some background information.  There are two kinds of NMEA sentences:
//
// 1. Standard NMEA sentences begin with "$ttccc", where
//      "tt" is the talker ID, and
//      "ccc" is the variable-length sentence type (i.e., command).
//
//    For example, "$GPGLL,..." is a GLL sentence (Geographic Lat/Long) 
//    transmitted by talker "GP".  This is the most common talker ID.  Some
//    devices may report "$GNGLL,..." when a mix of GPS and non-GPS
//    satellites have been used to determine the GLL data.
//
// 2. Proprietary NMEA sentences (i.e., those unique to a particular
//    manufacturer) begin with "$Pmmmccc", where
//      "P" is the NMEA-defined prefix indicator for proprietary messages,
//      "mmm" is the 3-character manufacturer ID, and
//      "ccc" is the variable-length sentence type (it can be empty).
//
// No validation of manufacturer ID and talker ID is performed in this
// base class.  For example, although "GP" is a common talker ID, it is not
// guaranteed to be transmitted by your particular device, and it IS NOT
// REQUIRED.  If you need validation of these IDs, or you need to use the
// extra information provided by some devices, you have two independent
// options:
//
// 1. Enable SAVING the ID: When /decode/ returns DECODE_COMPLETED, the
// /talker_id/ and/or /mfr_id/ members will contain ID bytes.  The entire
// sentence will be parsed, perhaps modifying members of /fix/.  You should
// enable one or both IDs if you want the information in all sentences *and*
// you also want to know the ID bytes.  This adds two bytes of RAM for the
// talker ID, and 3 bytes of RAM for the manufacturer ID.
//
// 2. Enable PARSING the ID:  The virtual /parse_talker_id/ and
// /parse_mfr_id/ will receive each ID character as it is parsed.  If it
// is not a valid ID, return /false/ to abort processing the rest of the
// sentence.  No CPU time will be wasted on the invalid sentence, and no
// /fix/ members will be modified.  You should enable this if you want to
// ignore some IDs.  You must override /parse_talker_id/ and/or
// /parse_mfr_id/ in a derived class.
